      <p class="paragraph">
        I joined the Govtech Video Analytics and AI Practice team back in May 2024. During my four-month internship at GovTech, I contributed to various content authentication and management initiatives as part of the AI Practice in the Government Technology Office (GTO). I worked on two main projects: the Out-of-Context Image-Caption Pair Detection and Curator, an Automated Media Indexing Management System.

        As an intellectually curious learner and innovative problem solver, I am excited to contribute to the AI Practiceâ€™s mission. This article reflects my journey from learning how to apply AI to solve real-world problems to deploying scalable AI systems for the public.

      <h3 class="heading"><b>Project 1: Out-of-Context Image-Caption Pair Detection</b></h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My first project involved developing a proof-of-concept (POC) for a multimodal cheap fake detector using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with zero-shot captioning fallback mechanism. The tool aims to identify mismatched image-caption pairs, helping the public distinguish between authentic and misleading content, particularly in the Singapore context.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Initially, I built a single-chain zero-shot captioning Vision Language Model (VLM) pipeline. However, the single-chain pipeline struggled with seemingly in-context but factually incorrect captions. Implementing a RAG pipeline with zero-shot captioning fallback increased accuracy by 27%.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Data played a crucial role in this project. I curated thousands of images with corresponding captions, generating both authentic and mismatched pairs. I created a vector database using LanceDB with hybrid search capabilities for improved accuracy.

      <h3 class="heading"><b>Curator: Automated Media Indexing Management System</b></h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My second project involved collaborating with the Government Digital Products team to develop a Whole-of-Government (WOG) media indexing management system. This initiative explored advanced multimodal AI capabilities, including multimodal search and automated tagging and captioning for both images and videos.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        A key component of this project was building a proof-of-concept (POC) for an entity search feature. I developed backend services that allowed users to search for related images based on an uploaded entity image with AWS Rekognition. This task required careful consideration of various design factors, with a particular focus on maximizing efficiency and minimizing latency.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Following backend development, I designed the frontend interface for this feature, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive experience. I integrated the frontend with the backend using NextJS. Comprehensive evaluation of the media indexing feature through prompt engineering further improved system performance.

        Throughout this journey, I gained valuable insights into scalability, data importance, and the significance of a supportive work environment. Scalability required designing architecture with future needs in mind, such as choosing between client-side and server-side rendering for different tasks.

        Data is fundamental to AI engineering, enhancing model performance through preprocessing and optimization. Additionally, the welcoming and innovative culture at GovTech enabled me to thrive and contribute effectively.

      <p class="paragraph">
        Looking back, joining GovTech was one of the best decisions I have made. Working on real-world AI projects has significantly enhanced my skills as an AI engineer, from testing and deployment, to understanding key design principles in large AI systems.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my mentor, Kyaw, and the entire AI Practice team for their unwavering support and for making my internship such a fulfilling experience. Their encouragement and the enjoyable moments we shared made me look forward to going to work every day. Lastly, I am deeply grateful for all the unforgettable memories and friendships made while planning the Intern bonding day!
